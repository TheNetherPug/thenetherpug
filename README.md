## Hiya! ðŸ‘‹
I'm TheNetherPug, a self-taught programmer and indie game dev with a love for Godot, Java and Minecraft modding!

### Current Projects
I'm currently working on:

  A minecraft mod that lets you create server-side particle effects with accurate collision using text display entities!<br>
  _COMING VERY SOON_
  
- **EasyLib** **[MOD**]ðŸŸ©<br>
  A small library that makes programming certain aspects minecraft mods a bit more convenient.<br>
  _(releases alongside Server Particles)_

  What's this?
