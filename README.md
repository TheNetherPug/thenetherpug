## Hiya! 👋
I'm TheNetherPug, a self-taught programmer and indie game dev with a love for Godot, Java and Minecraft modding!

### Current Projects
I'm currently working on:
- **Server Particles** **[MOD]**<br>
  A minecraft mod that lets you create server-side particle effects with accurate collision using text display entities!<br>
  _COMING VERY SOON_
  
- **EasyLib** **[MOD**]<br>
  A small library that makes programming certain aspects minecraft mods a bit more convenient.<br>
  _(releases alongside Server Particles)_
  
- **Project S** **[GAME]**<br> 
  What's this?
